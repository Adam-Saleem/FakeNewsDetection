The soccer world was rocked on Wednesday with news that Lionel Messi, one of the greatest to ever play the game, is coming to Major League Soccer and will play for Inter Miami CF after leaving Paris Saint-Germain.

It is a historic coup for U.S. soccer's top league and a huge sign of intent: the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner (soccer's biggest individual prize) will reportedly play in MLS through 2026, when the nation jointly hosts the next World Cup with Mexico and Canada. He's joining a team in need, with Inter Miami CF dead last in the MLS table, with 15 points from their first 16 games.
